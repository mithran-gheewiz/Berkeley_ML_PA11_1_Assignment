The objective is to analyze the provided dataset of 426,000 used cars to identify which features most strongly influence the vehicle's price.
This involves performing univariate and bivariate analyses by comparing the target variable (price) with individual predictor variables (i.e., mileage, year, brand, fuel type).
I will generate graphical summaries (i.e., boxplots, histograms, scatter plots) and numerical summaries (i.e., means, medians, correlations) to understand the distribution and relationships between price and other variables.
The goal is to uncover patterns and trends that can inform pricing strategies and highlight what car attributes consumers value most in the used car market.
